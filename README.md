## Task

In this competition, youâ€™ll automatically localize and classify 14 types of thoracic abnormalities from chest radiographs. 

You'll work with a dataset consisting of 18,000 scans that have been annotated by experienced radiologists. 

You can train your model with 15,000 independently-labeled images and will be evaluated on a test set of 3,000 images.

## Final Submission Deadline:
March 30, 2021

Deadline is at 11:59 PM UTC 

-------

## Evaluation

The challenge uses the standard PASCAL VOC 2010 mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU > 0.4.

-------

## Dataset information

The dataset comprises 18,000 postero-anterior (PA) CXR scans in DICOM format, which were de-identified to protect patient privacy. 

All images were labeled by a panel of experienced radiologists for the presence of 14 critical radiographic findings as listed below:

      0 - Aortic enlargement
      1 - Atelectasis
      2 - Calcification
      3 - Cardiomegaly
      4 - Consolidation
      5 - ILD
      6 - Infiltration
      7 - Lung Opacity
      8 - Nodule/Mass
      9 - Other lesion
      10 - Pleural effusion
      11 - Pleural thickening
      12 - Pneumothorax
      13 - Pulmonary fibrosis

The "No finding" observation (14) was intended to capture the absence of all findings above.

Note that a key part of this competition is working with ground truth from multiple radiologists.
